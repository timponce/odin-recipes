            with this homemade fresh pasta recipe from Binging with Babish.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Olive oil (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by making a mound of flour on your countertop with a well in the middle 
                that you can crask two or three eggs in.
            </li>
            <li>Followed by a little drizzle of olive oil (optional), and a pinch of salt.</li>
            <li>Grab a fork and beath/whisk the eggs, picking up a little flour with every stroke of the fork.</li>
            <li>Once it becomes too sticky grab a bench scraper and start folding everything towards the center.</li>
            <li>Once a shaggy dough starts to form, begin to knead the dough by hand for a solid 10 
                minutes. Knead until the dough had the consistency of play dough.
            </li>
            <li>Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and let sit in room temperature for at least thirty minutes. This 
                lets the gluten relax a bit before rolling it out.
            </li>
            <li>After 30 minutes, unwrap the dough and start flouring everything - your hands, the dough, the 
                rolling pin, and the countertop.
            </li>
            <li>Once finished flouring, cut the dough down the center into two halves.</li>
            <li>Now it’s time to start gently rolling/laminating it out. Roll like you would be using a pasta
                 machine by rolling it out followed by folding into thirds, turn it 90 degrees and then rolling 
                 out again.  Do this 3 times total before going for the big time roll. Roll until you can almost see your hand through it.
            </li>
            <li>Once you have the dough rolled out to size and thickness it is time to cut. Start by cutting off the edges to give you an 
                even rectangle. From here you can make lasagna noodles, or filled pasta like tortellini or ravioli.
            </li>
            <li>For simple pasta, loosely fold the dough cutting it into nice wide fettuccine pieces. Once finished cutting, unfold all of 
                the pieces to make sure none of them are stuck together.
            </li>
            <li>Once all of the noodles are unwound, lift up the noodles and toss them with a little bit of flour to make sure they don’t 
                stick together. Make sure each individual strand is coated with floured.
            </li>
            <li>Hang to dry or placed under plastic wrap until ready to use</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
